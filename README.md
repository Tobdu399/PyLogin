# PyLogin
This login system is made for Windows. This program requires python 3.6 or above. If you want this system to work on linux, download this system from here: https://github.com/Tobdu399/PyLoginLinux

This login system allows it's users to create or remove other accounts and change username or password

All files *must* be in same folder! You should have thses files: __pycache__(folder), data.dat, datafile.dat, login.py, user.dat, userData.py, userlist.dat, users.py

If you face any problems or you have ideas for my program, feel free to contact me: topias.j.m@gmail.com
