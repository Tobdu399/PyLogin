# PyLogin
This login system is made using Linux Mint and propably wont work on windows. To use this, you need some settings installed in your linux os:
1. neofetch  -> Can be installed with 'sudo apt install neofetch' in linux terminal
2. nautilus -> Can be installed with 'sudo apt-get install nautilus' in linux terminal (Default in Linux Ubuntu)
3. Python 3.6 or above

Basicly this login system needs your username and password and then there is just some random content. When you login for the first time username and password are these:
Username: Admin
Password: 12345
This work contains ability to change your username and/or your password and store it to savefile.dat. So next time you login you need to use the new username and/or password.
